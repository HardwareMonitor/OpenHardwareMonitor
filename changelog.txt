Changed the notify icon implementation to first try to modify an (existing) icon before trying to add a new one. When the WM_TASKBARCREATED event is raised, sometimes (changing the display scale for example) the icons still exist and fail to get added, while in other cases (explorer task restarted), the icons are lost and need to be added again. This fixes the 8s blocking of the UI thread when changing the display scale.

 9 files changed, 65 insertions(+), 43 deletions(-)

Modified and extended version of the patch v4 by Roland Reinl (see Issue 256). Main differences to the original patch: DeviceIoControl refactorings removed, SmartAttribute is now descriptive only and does not hold any state, report is written as one 80 columns table, sensors are created only for meaningful values and without duplicates (remaining life, temperatures, host writes and reads). Also the current implementation should really preserve all the functionality of the old system. Additionally there is now a simple SMART devices emulation class (DebugSmart) that can be used in place of WindowsSmart for testing with reported data.

The new implementation only saves the location and size when one of the two is changed.

Added a workaround for the "You must keep the stream open for the lifetime of the Image." problem of the Image.FromStream method. This also reduced the overall memory usage (private working set).

Attempt to fix an exception:
 1 file changed, 10 insertions(+), 16 deletions(-)

Fixed an UnauthorizedAccessException in the StartupManager. The exception occurred when the application was running without administrator rights. A task for the current user could be created manually, but RegisterTaskDefinition somehow always throws an UnauthorizedAccessException. The current fix restricts the TaskScheduler startup method to accounts with administrator rights.

Fixed Issue 24.
 1 file changed, 7 insertions(+), 7 deletions(-)

Rewritten the T-Balancer code to use the FTDI D2XX drivers directly instead of the System.IO.Ports.SerialPort class. The SerialPort class has some ugly problems like http://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/140018/serialport-crashes-after-disconnect-of-usb-com-port or http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/netfxbcl/thread/8a1825d2-c84b-4620-91e7-3934a4d47330 for which no real solution seems to exist. And Microsoft doesn't feel like it needs to be fixed for years now.

Changed the T-Balancer fields for the actual PWM (percent) value of the channels from 156+ to 137+, because on some (older?) hardware the fields 156+ seem not to be updated. Fields 137+ have one bit less resolution, but it's what the Navigator uses as well (and used only if in PWM mode).
